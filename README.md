# implementing-OSPF-link-state-LS-algorithm-
Calculates the shortest path cost and path taken for each node, when given a source node.

In the program, you will prompt for the number of routers and then read in a file containing values for an n x n cost matrix, where n is the number of routers entered by the user. asks the user to enter the character representation of the first node, such as u in the example given above so that your node representation is schematically correct. It Finally prompts the user to enter the source router from which to calculate the shortest path cost and path taken from the source node to each node in the graph in the correct order.
